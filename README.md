# hbbtvbrowserEXPERIMENTAL
A custom browser that supports the OIPF/HbbTV web standard as implemented in most smart TV sets allowing you to develop TV HTML Applications using the windows desktop.

As the name suggests this is an UNFINISHED and Still experimental version.

I've put this up on my github account in the state it's in for now as I have to switch to a different project, so it may be sometime before I actually get back to doing any majot work on this.

I will resume working on it at the first opportunity, but right now it serves as a reasonably good demo of how to use the new Microfot Edge/Cromium web view control in a windows forms application.

I'm adding an MIT licence on this, but honestly, since it's work in progress I really don't care what you do with it, beacuse until I get around to doing it properly and taking it out of experimental status, as far as I'm concerned it's only test code :-)

I've worked out some interesting ways to get the javascript side of things communicating with the windows side of things, using just whats available in thier right now.

I'm kinda hoping that MS gives us a better hook to tap into using "&lt;object&gt;&lt;</object>&gt;" tags and having them exposed to C# code, that would be the icing on the cake for me implementing this stuff :-)

Above all though, read the code, examine the methods, that's what it's intended for, it's not intended as a finished application...
